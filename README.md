# Exercises-in-Python
Here , you find out  there some basics  code  exercises  in Python

Exercise 5 

The parts store "La maquina" has hired you to make a digital program which allows the store to improve the sales of parts for cars that they drive in the store, the store always creates a list with the numbers of the parts that are missing, as well as another with the numbers of certain parts that they have to change. With these lists changes are made with other stores.

In this store, auto parts are classified in a certain way: "luxury", "premium", "pro", "special" and "normal". As it is logical to make changes, they will only be made by parts of the same classification. You must create a library called "parts" consisting of at least the following functions that will allow you to build the complete program:

The function "classifications" that given a list of the classifications of the parts of the inventory, generates a list with the classifications found without repetition.....

Exercise 3

You are the director of a new event for the mayor of a municipality, for the event attendees should register their arrival with some previously delivered ballots, each ballot has a randomly generated succession of digits, these ballots will be used for a raffle at the end of the day, but only certain ballots will participate.

To determine which ballots will participate, you must generate a program that accepts as input the first digits of the ballots as they were received at the entrance, and check how many times in a row that digit is repeated, you must print the list with the digits as shown. they were seen, separated by a space, and another list that will be the consecutive times they saw said digit, separated by a space.


Exercise 2

Schedule lines preferably in a movie theater.
game, each player, without repeating a certain amount of letters the letters are associated with a corresponding row of chairs 2 players

If the client chooses a chair from a selected row, the employer that chose it will earn one point.

comparison of employee points every time a new customer sits in each of the comparisons will write who is earning E, for employee 1

T, for employee 2

N, tie

INPUT VALUES Chain chosen by empl 1 chain chosen by empl 2 associated chain rows per user at the end of the day

OUTPUT VALUES HOW THE BOARD LOOKED

LOGICAL THINKING PROCESS
What I need? the values ​​of the string entered by the employer cannot be repeated

Each letter entered from the chain must be read, preference rows, and it must be compared with each of the employee chains, if something is found, it must be saved in a variable (note there must be one variable per employee and then they must be compared , and save the result in another variable, and then print.




Exercise 1

TOY & JOY GAMES
Dunk balls in a machine => Final score (x) According to the score you can choose between 4 different types of prizes.

prize1 = common-economic, x <= 20

prize2 = prize1 +, x> 20

prize3 = rare, x> 30

prize4 = collection, x> 50

How is the final score (x) determined?
(skill points + the number of times the ball has been scored during the game) / 5 = x

How are skill points calculated?
base score = 4 points plus score = 2 * each time he scores.

Analysis given
Input data
Number of times the participant was able to score the ball throughout the game.
Output data
Number of times the participant made a basket
Participant skill points
Final score of the participant
Type of award that the participant may choose. # conditional
